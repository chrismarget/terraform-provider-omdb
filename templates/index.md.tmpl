# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The OMDb provider facilitates interactions with the Open Movie Database.

Who would want such a thing? Me, for use as a template when working on more
complicated Terraform providers.

Really, this thing exists only to hone release process, documentation
generation, experiment with new versions of the Terraform Provider Framework
and the like. It's not a real provider.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Configuration
